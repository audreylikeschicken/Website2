                        <p>ERC is a stimulus program designed to help those businesses that were able to retain their employees during the Covid-19 pandemic. Established by the CARES Act, it is a refundable tax credit – a  grant, not a loan – that you can claim for your business. The ERC is  available to both small and mid-sized businesses. It is based on  qualified wages and healthcare paid to employees.</p>
                        <p>• Up to $26,ooo per employee</p>
                        <p>• Available for 2020 and the first 3 quarters of 2021</p>
                        <p>• Qualify with decreased revenue or COVID event</p>
                        <p>• No limit on funding</p>
                        <p>• ERC is a refundable tax credit</p>

                        <p>To qualify, your business must have been negatively impacted in either of  the following ways:</p>
                        <p>• A government authority  required partial or full shutdown of your business during 2020 or 2021.  This includes your operations being limited by commerce, inability to  travel or restrictions of group meetings.</p>
                        <p>• Gross receipt reduction  criteria is different for 2020 and 2021, but is measured against the  current quarter as compared to 2019 pre-COVID amounts.</p>
                        <p>• A business can be eligible for one quarter and not another. </p>
                        <p>• Initially, under the CARES  Act of 2020, businesses were not able to qualify for the ERC if they had already received a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan. With new  legislation in 2021, employers are now eligible for both programs. The  ERC, though, cannot apply to the same wages as the ones for PPP. </p>
